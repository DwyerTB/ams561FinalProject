AMS Final Project Drafts

Project Objectives
The goal of this project was to write a program to reimplement the Morse Code MATLAB code, from Experiments with MATLAB (Moler, 2011) in Python. The success of the project was tested by the translation exercise (19.1) in the MATLAB pdf and additional encoding (Alphabetic input to Morse Code output) and decoding (Morse Code input to Alphabetic Output) experiments listed in the Results section of this report. This was an individual project and therefore, there are no team contributions to be listed.
